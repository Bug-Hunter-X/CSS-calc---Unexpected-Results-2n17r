The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used carefully.  For example, consider this code:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

If the parent element of `.element` has a width less than 10px, `calc()` will return a negative value, resulting in unexpected behavior.

Another common issue is the usage of units within `calc()`.  Make sure that all units are consistent. Mixing units (e.g. `px` and `%`) within the calculation can cause rendering problems.
